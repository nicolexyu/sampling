# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The quality of the sample is likely to be good because a stratified random sampling strategy is being used. This ensures that every department with high turnover is adequately represented. By dividing the population into strata based on departments and sampling randomly within each stratum, the survey will capture the variability across departments, making the sample more representative of the target population. However, there is still a possibility of nonresponse bias if certain groups of employees, those more dissatisfied are less likely to respond to the survey, and those have already left the company may opt out of the survey.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    Yes. Some improvements could enhance the quality of the survey.

    Revised Survey

    - Q1: How satisfied are you with your current role and responsibilities?
    ‚óã [No change]

    - Q2: To what extent do you feel supported by your immediate supervisor?
    ‚óã Change and reasoning: Add "Not applicable (I don‚Äôt have an immediate supervisor)" to account for cases where this question might not be relevant.  

    - Q3: Do you feel that the company provides adequate resources for professional development?
    ‚óã Change and reasoning: Add a follow-up open-ended question for respondents to elaborate on "what resources do you feel that are lacking?". Improving the quality of data by including follow up questions for more context. 
    
    - Q4: How frequently do you experience work-related stress?
    ‚óã Change and reasoning: Modify the question to ""How frequently do you feel overwhelmed or anxious due to work-related factors?" to ensure respondents understand the type of stress being addressed. 
    
    - Q5: Do you feel the company offers a good work-life balance?
    ‚óã Change and reasoning: Include a follow-up question to allow respondents to explain their answer, such as ‚ÄúWhat factors influence your work-life balance?‚Äù. Improving the quality of data by including follow up questions for more context.

    - Q6: How would you rate the opportunities for career growth within the company?
    ‚óã [No change]

    - Q7: Have you considered leaving the company in the past six months?
    ‚óã [No change]

    - Q8: If you answered "Yes" to the previous question, please select the primary reasons that made you consider leaving.
    ‚óã Change and reasoning: Add a disclaimer to assure respondents of anonymity and confidentiality: "Your responses are anonymous and confidential. This survey is conducted to improve employee satisfaction.".

    - Q9: Would you recommend this company to a friend or colleague?
    ‚óã Change and reasoning: Instead of "Yes," "No," and "Not Sure," simplify to just "Yes" or "No." Simplifies analysis and reduces ambiguity in responses.

    - Q10: What improvements would you suggest to increase job satisfaction?
    ‚óã Change and reasoning: Add a prompt encouraging respondents to focus on actionable suggestions (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat specific steps do you think the company could take to improve job satisfaction?‚Äù). 

    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    No, the purpose of my survey could not have been entirely fulfilled through an observational study. While observational data (e.g., turnover rates, HR reports, exit interviews) could reveal patterns, it lacks the ability to capture the subjective experiences, opinions, and preferences of employees, such as their feelings about work-life balance or their reasons for considering leaving the company. A survey is necessary to gather this qualitative and quantitative feedback directly from employees.
    
    Combining an observational study with the survey results could enhance the analysis by identifying alignment (or discrepancies) between observed trends and self-reported experiences.
    ```
