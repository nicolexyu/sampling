|----------------|:--------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Sample type                                           |  Stratified random sampling.   | Non-probability online panel. Stratified by region and balanced by gender and age within regions.  |   Targeted biological sampling using mist nets in Costa Rica.    |
| Sample size                                           |  Approximately 20,000 respondents. |  37,822 respondents for campaign period survey. 10,340 respondents for post election survey.  |  112 bats captured; 38 fecal samples analyzed, 25 of which contained insect DNA.     |
| Target population                                     | Individuals aged 15 years and older living in private households in Canada, excluding residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and full-time residents of institutions. | Canadian citizens and permanent residents aged 18 or older.  |  Glossophaga soricina (nectar-feeding bats) in the Area de ConservaciÃ³n Guanacaste, Costa Rica.   |
| Sampling frame                                        | Based on Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. Derived from the Census and administrative data. |   Participants recruited through online panels sourced via Qualtrics, stratified by province, gender, age groups and education level.  |  Bats in natural habitats within specific areas of Costa Rica.       |
| Survey mode(s)                                        | Primarily online, with telephone and paper options. |  Online survey administered through the Qualtrics platform.  |  Field sampling, DNA metabarcoding for dietary analysis, and behavioral experiments.   |
| Timeline                                              | Data collected in 2018. |  Campaign Period Survey: September 13 â€“ October 21, 2019. Post-Election Survey: October 24 â€“ November 11, 2019.  |  Fieldwork conducted over seven weeks, Mayâ€“July 2009; behavioral experiments recorded in a laboratory setting post-fieldwork.  |
| Response rate                                         | Approximately 49%.  |  Not formally reported due to non-probability design. |    Not applicable for this observational and experimental study.    |
| Weights                                               |  To ensure population representativeness and account for survey design and non-response. | Weight variables were created using an iterative raking process to ensure representativeness for gender, age, region, and education level, based on the 2016 Canadian Census.  |   Not applicable.  |
| Data processing                                       | Includes editing, imputation for missing data, and validation.   |  Data cleaning included removal of incomplete responses, duplicates, and low-quality responses such as straightliners or speeders.   |   DNA extraction, sequencing, and analysis for dietary identification; behavioral experiments recorded via infrared cameras and ultrasonic microphones.    |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            |  Missing or inconsistent responses were imputed using donor imputation or other standard methodologies.|   Respondents flagged for inattentiveness or duplicate responses. Weights were adjusted iteratively to compensate for sample biases.  |   Quality control of DNA data to ensure accurate species identification and dietary analysis.  |
| Sources of error                                      | Sampling error, non-response bias, and coverage error.              |   Sampling bias due to non-probability panel design, non-response error, and potential biases from demographic imbalance in online panel recruitment.    |   Misclassification in metabarcoding results. Small sample size.   |
| Limitations, known biases                             |  Excludes institutionalized populations and residents of territories, potential underrepresentation of certain demographics and changes to core questions.   |   Limited generalizability due to reliance on online panel data.   | Limited geographical scope and small sample size.    |
